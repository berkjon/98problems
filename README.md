\#98Problems is a tool to organize music on Spotify using tags instead of traditional playlists.  After importing their Spotify library and tagging tracks with various characteristics, users can filter their collection and generate on-the-fly playlists containing only songs matching a particular set of attributes (e.g. "workout', "mashup", instrumental").  Playlists are instantly exported to Spotify for easy listening on the go.

This was a solo project built in one week at Dev Bootcamp.

## Screen Grabs
#### 1) Adding Tags to Tracks
* After authenticating via Spotify and importing their music library, users go through a one-time setup process to add tags to all their tracks
* In a future release, I plan to offer the ability to automatically add tags based on the name of any Spotify playlists the user already has a track in

#### 2) Filtering
* Filter music collection by selecting specific tags from the top of the page (e.g. "hip hop" and "duet" in this example)
  * Only tracks containing both these tags will be returned

#### 3) Exporting to Spotify
* After filtering, instantly export all matching tracks to a new playlist on Spotify with the click of a button
* New Spotify playlist follows predictable naming pattern, so it is easy to tell playlists apart and distinguish those generated by #98Problems from all others

#### 4) Side by Side Comparison
* Filtered list on #98Problems (left) contains the same tracks as the newly created Spotify playlist (right)
